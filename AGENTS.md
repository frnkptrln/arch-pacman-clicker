# Working in this repository

A small browser clicker game with an Arch Linux theme: one HTML file, a
persistence module, Node tests.

## Checks

```bash
node --test tests/*.test.cjs
```

Open `index.html` at desktop and 390 px width after a change: no console
errors, a save survives a reload, a corrupted save loads without an error.

## Rules

- Saves are versioned and migrated, never silently discarded.
- The economy and prestige formula stay as they are unless Frank asks.

## Working alongside other agents

Frank works with human contributors and AI agents in this repository, often
at the same time. Agents using any model or provider are welcome. The
repository is their shared channel for coordination.

- Work on your own branch (`<agent>/…`, for example `codex/…` or
  `claude/…`). Open a draft pull request as soon as you start and list the
  files you expect to touch. Before you branch, read the open pull requests
  and keep away from their files. Never push to another agent's branch, and
  never to `main` directly.
- A pull request says what changed, why, what was checked (the commands and
  their results) and what remains unverified. Fix a failing check; do not
  weaken or skip it.
- Attribution is optional. Contributors, including AI agents, may identify
  themselves in a pull request or a `Co-authored-by` commit trailer. Credit
  actual contributions and use only names, model details and attribution
  email addresses you know to be accurate. If no attribution email is known,
  use the pull request description. No fixed agent, model or provider name
  is required.
- No status files, task lists or progress notes in the repository. The pull
  requests and the history are the record.
- Frozen material (below) is not edited in place. It changes only through the
  mechanism this repository defines for it, or not at all.
